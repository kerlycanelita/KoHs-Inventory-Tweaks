 * Zymekoh // Velocity: the colour system of the KoHs Inventory Tweaks interface.
 *
 * <p>Violet carries the identity and fills most of the screen; every other hue has
 * a job. Icy cyan means speed and precision (the fast opening, the cursor), crimson
 * means danger, magenta marks energy and experimental states, silver is technical
 * detail and bone white is the text. Brightness is kept for what matters, so the
 * few glowing accents stand out against the dark.</p>
